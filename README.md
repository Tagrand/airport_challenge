## Synopsis

We have a request from a client to write the software to control the flow of planes at an airport. Built in ruby, the software means planes can land and take off provided that the weather is good. Occasionally it may be stormy, in which case no planes can land or take off. he programme is also feature tested to make sure the whole system to make sure the planes and airports all work together well.
